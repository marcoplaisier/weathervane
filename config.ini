[Stations]
# Stations are configurable here. If the first station gives corrupt data, then data from the fallback station is used.
# The Bilt is usually a good choice because it should be well maintained, due to its proximity to the KNMI, and is
# centrally located in the Netherlands.

[Bit Packing]
# Bit packing is used to compress the data into bytes.
# You can set the ordering, the amount of bits each value can take, the minimum and maximum possible value. The other
# values will be interpolated linearly
# Possible values
# airpressure - air pressure in hPA, rounded to one thousandth; not available for all stations
# barometric_trend - whether the air pressure is stable, trending upward, or trending downward compared to four hours ago
# data_from_fallback - whether some or all data is retrieved for the secondary station
# feeltemperature - apparent temperature in degrees centigrade, rounded to one degree
# groundtemperature - the temperature in degrees centigrade, measured at 10 cm above ground, rounded to one tenths
# humidity - relative humidity in %, rounded to one degree
# lat - the latitude of the location of the weatherstation, rounded to 1 hundredth
# lon - the longitude of the location of the weatherstation, rounded to 1 hundreth
# rainFallLastHour - the measured amount of rain in mm/hour over the last hour,
# stationname - name of the weather station
# sunpower - power received from the sun in w/m2
# temperature - temperature in degrees centigrade, rounded to one tenth
# timestamp - the date and time when the measurement was taken, rounded to ten minutes
# visibility - the maximum viewing distance in meters, rounded to the closest 100 meters. Not available for all stations
# weatherdescription - textual representation of the current weather. At most 50 characters
# winddirection - wind direction in compass (16 possibilities)
# winddirectiondegrees - wind direction in degrees, from 0 to 359 degrees, rounded to one tenths of a degree
# windgusts - maximum wind speed measured (gusts), rounded to one tenth
# windspeed - wind speed in m/s, rounded to one hundredth
# windspeedBft - wind speed on Beaufort scale
# byte location, name, length, min, max, step_size
